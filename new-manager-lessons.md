# Lessons from a new manager

## Proximity solves a lot of problems
I don't mean remote vs on site. I mean sitting with the engieers vs sitting in the "design team area". On first look having all your designers in one place in the office seems great. Everyone can collaborate easily, team cohesion grows, and as a manager you can keep an eye on what people are doing.

The downfall occurs when your team has to work with other people...which is always. Ultimately the designers don't ship anything. It's up to your engineers to actually build the designs you create. Thus keeping the designers in the trenches 1. builds the designer-developer relationship and empathy for both roles 2. better ensures someone sees the _finished_ product before it goes into production. 

## Research gives you the ammunition to do what's right for the user. 
Stakeholders all have their own competing priorities. If your goal is to do right by your users, research is your weapon to compete with the other voices business, engineering, etc.
 

## If you love your designs, set them free!
Lots has been written about managing existing design team, however what happens when you're scaling rapidly and all of a sudden you're now a design manager instead of _just_ a designer.

For me, managing designers has been about letting go. When working on a product team I used to sweat every detail and fight with PMs and Engineers to get things just right. When managing other designers this is a recipe for failure. It's ok if your designers have a different process or different aesthetic preferences. In fact that's often a positive. Being a good design manager is about separating a sound design solutions from your personal taste. 

## Go on vacation
- It allows your team breathing room
- It allows strong performers to step-up in your absence
- It allows the team to work together without your oversight which reduces the need for micromanagement
