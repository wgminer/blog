# How the design team at 2U runs

## Preface

There has been a plethora written about how product-focused engineering teams should and do operate. Design on the other hand gets a few mentions here-or-there. However, from my own (desperate) research, I've found little _real-talk_ about what makes a functional product design organization. 

First, a few caveats. The type of product design I'll be referencing is the kind that has typically be associated with web 2.0, user experience, and companies like Facebook, Twitter, etc. Think [insert famous tech designer] and not Jonathan Ive (aka industrial design). 

Second, some notes about 2U. If you haven't heard of us go here. What's important to know for this article is that currently, engineering and product functions both reside in the "Tech Dev" organization under the CTO (why this is the case is an entire different discussion). At the time of the writing we have about ?? engineers focused on customer facing products and 5 designers complimenting them. Additionally, we have 5 Product Managers and 5 Business Analysts in the mix. 

Ok, let's get to it.

## Who does what

One of the most important parts of structuring a team is answering the question who does what. After a certain point of growth, the amount of design work coming at a designer and/or group of designers becomes too much and you have to divvy up the work.

At 2U, we do this by having designers assigned to an individual product team. Taking cues from Spotify's organization structure each product team in Tech Dev operates like its own mini startup. These teams will consist of 4-5 Engineers, a product manager, a business analyst, and 1-2 designers. This is (hopefully) physically close to each other in the office and spends the majority of it's time interacting internally. This structure is fairly new to the company but has been working out so far. In the past, we tried alternate arrangements and I'll I touch on these in the "Thing's we used to do" section. 

### Why does this arrangement work for our design team? 

First, it allows designers to get intimately familiar with and own the product they're designing. At 2U, our products often serve very different user personas - From an adjunct professor, to prospective students, to student support specialist. Each of these groups has very different needs and expectations from a UI and thus requires different design patterns. Additionally, when a designer can stick with a product through several release cycles they see the successes and failures of their work and can grow from it.

Second, it lets product managers call the shots. The main job of the product manager is to own and be accountable for a product's performance. In order to do be effective, the PM needs to have access to the human resources that'll actually build the product (eg. designers and devs). By _giving_ a designer to a product team you give the PM the tools to do their job. What this mean is: no more negotiating about resources; If a PM wants something designed they have a person dedicated to do it. 

Third, it allows the product team to gel. When a designer can be added and subtracted from a team at will, consistent members of the team often become agitated and skeptical. 


## Keeping the team together

One of the challenges with a distributed design team is maintaining a sense of cohesion. Being the lone designer is a difficult role to play especially if you're junior or are less outspoken.

We build cohesion at 2U through a number of recurring team activities. I talk about these in-depth in my previous post however, breifly we hold:

- *Daily standup* to announce what each person is working on for the day
- *Weekly Chapter* to discuss our practice as designers
- *Monthly Design Review* to gather design feedback and review a design's process
- *Monthly Team Lunch* because food is delicious and brings people together. 

On top of each designer's team level
