As an individual contributor, you could get by just being awesome all by yourself. Now, everyone has to be awesome <em>with</em> you…crap. Then, as is often the case, you’re the new manager of a new <em>team</em> too. Double crap. What’s your team’s place in the company? What work do you do? What’re you inchange of? I’ll share some of my own</p>
<h2 id="1-Get-a-support-structure-ASAP"><a href="#1-Get-a-support-structure-ASAP" class="headerlink" title="1. Get a support structure ASAP"></a>1. Get a support structure ASAP</h2><p>Going it alone probably comes natural to you. After all, you probably got promoted because you were better at your job (at least in your manager’s eyes) than someone else.</p>
<h2 id="2-Understand-the-business-value-of-you-and-your-team"><a href="#2-Understand-the-business-value-of-you-and-your-team" class="headerlink" title="2. Understand the business value of you and your team"></a>2. Understand the business value of you and your team</h2><p>Why do managers even exist? This is something I and many new managers wrestle with. This question is particularly hot in the org strategy instrudyt and the main points tend to be</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Doloremque voluptatum porro dicta illum quam voluptatem! Accusantium consequatur, veritatis sapiente recusandae veniam excepturi vel similique modi rerum facilis, autem quae animi.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For me, understanding <em>why</em> I was important helped silence the demons of feeling irrelevant or in the way.</p>
<p>For a new team this is doubly important. When working with new people who don’t “get it”, you’ll need a flawless pitch to quickly get them up to speed on the importance of your team.</p>
<h2 id="Proximity-solves-a-lot-of-problems"><a href="#Proximity-solves-a-lot-of-problems" class="headerlink" title="Proximity solves a lot of problems"></a>Proximity solves a lot of problems</h2><p>I don’t mean remote vs on site. I mean sitting with the engieers vs sitting in the “design team area”. On first look, having all your designers in one place in the office seems great. Everyone can collaborate easily, team cohesion grows, and as a manager you can keep an eye on what people are doing.</p>
<p>The downfall occurs when your team has to work with other people…which is always. Ultimately the designers don’t ship anything. It’s up to your engineers to actually build the designs you create. Thus keeping the designers in the trenches 1. builds the designer-developer relationship and empathy for both roles 2. better ensures someone sees the <em>finished</em> product before it goes into production.</p>
<h2 id="Figuring-out-where-PMing-ends-and-Designing-begins-is-hard"><a href="#Figuring-out-where-PMing-ends-and-Designing-begins-is-hard" class="headerlink" title="Figuring out where PMing ends and Designing begins is hard"></a>Figuring out where PMing ends and Designing begins is hard</h2><h2 id="Build-a-team-for-longevity"><a href="#Build-a-team-for-longevity" class="headerlink" title="Build a team for longevity"></a>Build a team for longevity</h2><h2 id="Have-a-researcher"><a href="#Have-a-researcher" class="headerlink" title="Have a researcher"></a>Have a researcher</h2><p>Designers are great. They’re the swiss-army knife of the product team -<br>Stakeholders all have their own competing priorities. If your goal is to do right by your users, research is your weapon to compete with the other voices business, engineering, etc.</p>
<h2 id="If-you-love-your-designs-set-them-free"><a href="#If-you-love-your-designs-set-them-free" class="headerlink" title="If you love your designs, set them free!"></a>If you love your designs, set them free!</h2><p>Lots has been written about managing existing design team, however what happens when you’re scaling rapidly and all of a sudden you’re now a design manager instead of <em>just</em> a designer.</p>
<p>For me, managing designers has been about letting go. When working on a product team I used to sweat every detail and fight with PMs and Engineers to get things just right. When managing other designers this is a recipe for failure. It’s ok if your designers have a different process or different aesthetic preferences. In fact that’s often a positive. Being a good design manager is about separating a sound design solutions from your personal taste.</p>
<h2 id="Go-on-vacation"><a href="#Go-on-vacation" class="headerlink" title="Go on vacation"></a>Go on vacation</h2><ul>
<li>It allows your team breathing room</li>
<li>It allows strong performers to step-up in your absence</li>
<li>It allows the team to work together without your oversight which reduces the need for micromanagement</li>
</ul>
