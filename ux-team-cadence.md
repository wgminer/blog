# Cadence of a Design Team

I've found that consistency and predictability are hugely important aspects of managing a healthy team. On the UX team at 2U we have several recurring activities that structure our work. In this article I detail each of them.

## Things we do
Currently, (21-04-2016) we have four activities 

### Stand-up (Daily)
If you've work on an Agile team before you probably already know what this is. For those that don't its a quick (<10m) meeting where each person _very_ briefly talks about what they're working on that day and elicits any help from the larger team. 

#### Why we do it
1. As the manager, I like stand-up because it keeps me abreast of what everyone is doing and gives me a heads-up about any conversations I need to have that day.
2. For the ICs it caps off their day and gives a consistent time to arrive in the office by.  
3. Also, because we often make use of [Pivotal Labs style design paring]() it's where people typically request a pairing partner.
4. Finally, because we all work on different product teams seeing all the other UX people each morning keeps the team feeling intact. 

#### Keys to success
- *Keep it short and on task* Because we do standup everyday its hard to ignore when it's not going well or taking too much time. Especially when you're just getting started, having someone to gather quorum, cut-off ramblers (you know who you are!), and keep the group on task is really important.
- *Be on time* Standup is so short that being 5 minutes late can double the length of the meeting. Build a culture of being on time, every time. Also, if necessary start without tardy folks.  

### Chapter (Weekly)

### Design Review (Bi-Weekly)

### Team Lunch (Monthly)

### UX State of the Union (Twice a year)

## Things we _used_ to do
A good portfolio shows the process of getting to the final design. Similarly, I want to end this post with a look back at all the activities that just didn't work out:

### "Learning Day" (Monthly-ish)
This was a monthly day where we'd put aside whatever "work" projects we were on a set out to learn or explore some new skill. If you couldn't tell, this was inspired by Google's 80/20 time. 

#### Why it didn't work
Two reasons: First, we were constantly rescheduling it around project deadlines. When your team is distributed across a number of different products finding a day where no-one is pushing towards some deadline is nearly impossible. Second, giving just one day to "learning" is pretty crappy. Learning is something that should be happening continuously. Also, if you're really passionate about learning something waiting for a codified day at work isn't realistic.

### Show and tell board (Weekly)
For this, each week - typically on Friday - we would print and hang at least one thing we worked on the previous week. This activity was part of an effort to communicate what we do to the rest of the tech department.

#### Why it didn't work
The first mistake was that we decided to do it on Friday afternoon. This was a problem because Fridays at 2U NYC aren't exactly the most productive days. We do a big team lunch which leaves everyone a bit sleepy and then end things with a big social beer thing, starting around 330/400. Getting anything from anyone after around noon is a chore.
